# RoomDB-core

RoomDB is a Datalog-style database inspired by the implementation of the [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) project. It enables programmers to represent facts using natural language, with a syntax adapted from my [NL-Datalog project](https://github.com/harc/nl-datalog).

This repo is just the core grammar, assert, retract and select. You probably want [RoomDB](https://github.com/alexwarth/roomdb) to play around with, which includes a server and easier to use javascript client.

## Examples

see [RoomDB][], [roomdb-server][], and [roomdb-client][] for examples of integrating the engine.
